# challenge_03_code_quiz
This challenge is a timed quiz covering questions from this bootcamp.

Current version does not meet all requirements for assignment:

The user is first presented with the option to take a quiz. 
Once the quiz starts, a 60 second timer also starts counting down.
The user is able to select an answer and then the next question appears.
Once all of the questions have been answered, the user is presented with their score and asked to enter their initals.

Currently, the timer running out, does display an alert, but does not stop the user from playing.
Also, the functionality to be able to save your initials and read the high scores is not working yet.
These two items need to be completed in the future for to complete the functionality required.
